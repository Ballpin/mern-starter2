// arguments of compose from right to left).
// Firstly the "withJob" is attached, indicating we want to do some async work.
// Then the redux "connect" is attached.
// This means the redux state and action will be passed through our "withJob".
// The job is meant to fire the fetching of a post.  If no post exists within
// the redux state it will fire the "fetchPost" redux-thunk action.  If you
// look at that action you will see it returns a Promise. It is a requirement
// to return a Promise when executing an asynchronous job so that the job
// runner knows when the job is complete.  You will also see that we first
// check to see if the post already exists within the state, if so we just
// return it which would then result in a synchronous execution of our component.
